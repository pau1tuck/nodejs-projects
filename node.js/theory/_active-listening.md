# Activated Listening

Active listening and mindfulness meditation are both techniques that can greatly improve your focus and comprehension while reading or during conversations. Here are some standard and unique approaches to these practices:

## Activated Listening

1. *Standard Techniques*:

   * **Clarifying**: Ask questions to ensure you understand what's being said.
   * **Paraphrasing**: Repeat what you've heard or read in your own words. This tests your understanding and helps embed information in your memory.
   * **Summarizing**: At regular intervals, summarize the key points or themes. This helps consolidate your understanding.
   * **Reflecting**: Reflect on the emotions or intentions behind the words. This builds empathy and deeper understanding.

2. *Unique Techniques*:

   * **Mirroring Body Language**: In conversation, subtly mirroring the speaker's body language can create empathy and improve comprehension.
   * **Silent Reflection**: Pausing before responding gives you time to fully process information.
   * **Visualizing**: Create mental images of the concepts or stories you're listening to. This is especially helpful for abstract or complex ideas.

## Mindful Listening

1. *Standard Techniques*:

   * **Focused Attention**: Concentrate on each word as you read. Whenever your mind wanders, gently guide it back.
   * **Pacing**: Use a pointer or your finger to guide your reading speed. This can help maintain focus.
   * **Breathing**: Pair your reading with your breath. For example, read a sentence as you inhale and the next as you exhale.

2. *Unique Techniques*:

   * **Savoring**: Take time to fully appreciate a powerful sentence or beautifully written passage.
   * **Non-judgmental Observation**: If your mind wanders, simply notice without judgement and gently return to your reading.
   * **Body Sensing**: Notice the sensation of holding the book, or the feeling of your eyes moving across the page. This heightens awareness and helps anchor your focus.

Using these techniques can turn both listening and reading into more engaging and productive experiences. They can improve your comprehension and retention of information, and also make the processes more enjoyable and less taxing.
