# Understanding Promises, Async and Await in JavaScript

JavaScript, as a language, is well-known for its asynchronicity which means that if any action takes a while, your program can continue doing other things while the action completes, and once the action is completed, you can do something with the result. The asynchronicity feature is highly beneficial in scenarios such as data fetching, although it can be quite challenging to comprehend for beginners. JavaScript provides several ways to handle asynchronous programming, among which are callback functions, Promises, and async-await [[4](https://dev.to/nas5w/asynchronous-javascript-how-callbacks-promises-and-async-await-work-1f7p)].

## Callback Functions

A callback function is a function that you provide to be executed after the completion of an asynchronous operation [[4](https://dev.to/nas5w/asynchronous-javascript-how-callbacks-promises-and-async-await-work-1f7p)]. Callback functions represent the traditional method to handle asynchronous operations, which is particularly visible in AJAX operations [[2](https://itnext.io/javascripts-async-await-versus-promise-the-great-debate-6308cb2e10b3)].

For instance, consider an asynchronous operation where user data is fetched from an API. In a scenario without a callback, the data does not exist until the fetch operation completes. To be able to do something with this data, we can pass a callback function that will handle the data once the fetch operation is done.

The issue with callbacks becomes apparent as applications grow in complexity. As multiple asynchronous operations become nested within each other, the code becomes more difficult to read and understand - a situation often referred to as "callback hell" [[1](https://overclocked.medium.com/truly-understanding-javascript-promises-await-and-async-f3f51e283554)].

## Promises

Promises in JavaScript represent the eventual completion of an asynchronous operation. A Promise can either be resolved or rejected. When a Promise resolves, you can handle its returned value with the `then()` method. If a Promise is rejected, you can use `catch()` to handle the error [[4](https://dev.to/nas5w/asynchronous-javascript-how-callbacks-promises-and-async-await-work-1f7p)].

Promises are objects that represent the result of an asynchronous operation that may not be available yet. A Promise can be chained with other promises using `.then()` and `.catch()` methods, or passed to other functions that expect a Promise [[3](https://www.linkedin.com/advice/1/what-some-best-practices-tips-writing-clean-readable-async)].

They offer a more organized way to handle asynchronous operations as compared to callbacks, and greatly improve code readability and maintainability, which helps to avoid the issues commonly associated with callback hell [[1](https://overclocked.medium.com/truly-understanding-javascript-promises-await-and-async-f3f51e283554)].

## Async/Await

Async/Await in JavaScript is essentially syntactic sugar on top of Promises, making asynchronous code look and behave more like synchronous code. The `async` keyword is used to define an asynchronous function that returns a Promise, and `await` is used to pause the execution of the function until a Promise is resolved or rejected [[2](https://itnext.io/javascripts-async-await-versus-promise-the-great-debate-6308cb2e10b3)].

The async-await syntax allows for cleaner and more readable code that operates with Promises, effectively avoiding the callback hell scenario. It also simplifies error handling in asynchronous code, as try-catch blocks can be used in a similar way to synchronous code [[3](https://www.linkedin.com/advice/1/what-some-best-practices-tips-writing-clean-readable-async)].

Even though both Promises and Async/Await end up accomplishing the same thing, handling asynchronous data calls in a performant, consistent manner, your choice between the two often depends on your specific use case and personal preference [[2](https://itnext.io/javascripts-async-await-versus-promise-the-great-debate-6308cb2e10b3)].

# Conclusion

Understanding Promises, Async/Await, and Callbacks is key to mastering asynchronous JavaScript. While callbacks were the traditional method of handling asynchronous JavaScript, the introduction of Promises and Async/Await have made writing and reading asynchronous JavaScript more manageable and intuitive. It's important to note that these aren't mutually exclusive or sequential improvements - rather, they are different tools available within the language, each suitable for different scenarios. A good grasp of these concepts will enable you to write efficient and clean JavaScript code, better equipped to handle complex tasks.
